# Network Analysis of Chord Progressions in Ray Charles Songs

This was the final project for the Network Analysis class, where we developed the conceptual foundation by understanding concepts such as Scale-Free Networks, the Albert-Barab√°si Model, Clustering, Density, Robustness, and Weighted, Directed and Undirected Networks.

The data for this project was extracted from https://www.e-chords.com/ray-charles. The main idea was to compile the chords from Ray Charles' songs into a network where the links represent the song progression and the nodes represent the chords, which are the building blocks of songs. We aimed to construct a network of chord progressions to observe the unique characteristics of Ray Charles' songs, his choice of chords, and the patterns in his music.
