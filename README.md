# Network-Analysis-of-Chord-Progressions-in-Ray-Charles-Songs
In this Project, we studied the structure of Ray Charle's songs from a Network Science perspective, where chords were nodes and the transition between two chords was a link. A visualization in the form of a spiral to visualize the density of the network was proposed and the robustness was analyzed.
