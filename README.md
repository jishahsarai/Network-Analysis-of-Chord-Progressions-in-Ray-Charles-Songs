# Network Analysis of Chord Progressions in Ray Charles Songs

This was the final project for the Network Analysis class, where we developed the conceptual foundation by understanding concepts such as Scale-Free Networks, the Albert-Barabási Model, Clustering, Density, Robustness, and Weighted, Directed and Undirected Networks.

The data for this project was extracted from https://www.e-chords.com/ray-charles. The main idea was to compile the chords from Ray Charles' songs into a network where the links represent the song progression and the nodes represent the chords, which are the building blocks of songs. We aimed to construct a network of chord progressions to observe the unique characteristics of Ray Charles' songs, his choice of chords, and the patterns in his music.

In the "Gephi-files" folder, you will find the created network extracted from 88 songs, which is directed and weighted, consisting of 167 nodes and 1246 edges, you will find other networks derived from this one, a presentation and a report of the network analysis in PDF format.
Aditionally you will find two notebooks:
- "Structure of Music": Provides essential definitions of music from a graph perspective.
- "Network Analysis" (using the data folder): Contains code for performing Robustness analysis and creating a personalized spiral plot to enhance visualization of a network with high density between hubs.

## Learning Oucomes
- Construct directed and weighted networks to represent chord progressions in Ray Charles' songs, and visualize these networks and it's important charctheristics using tools like Gephi and Python packages including NetworkX, Networks_Robustness, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
- Sthregthened fundamental concepts such as Scale-Free Networks, the Albert-Barabási Model, Clustering Coefficients, Density, and Robustness in network analysis.
- Executed data cleaning with pandas to achieve better performance in analysis and extract important patterns in the network.
